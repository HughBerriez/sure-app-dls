# SureApp Design System POC by Hugh Berryman - Storybook and Chromatic workflow with NextJS Landing Page

## Introduction

This project, developed by Hugh Berryman, is for my application for the Design Technologist role at SureApp (2024). It demonstrates integration of Next.js, Storybook, and Chromatic, focusing on scalable UI component development and testing.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.

## Development Workflow

1. **Next.js App**: Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
2. **Storybook**: Use `npm run storybook` for UI development and testing.
3. **Chromatic**: Execute `npm run chromatic` to publish to Chromatic (requires a project token).

## Building for Production

- For Next.js: `npm run build`
- For Storybook: `npm run build-storybook`
